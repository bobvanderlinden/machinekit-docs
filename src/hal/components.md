Commands and Userspace Components<span id="sec:Commands-and-Userspace-Components"></span>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of the commands in the following list have man pages. Some will have expanded descriptions, some will have limited descriptions. Also, all of the components listed below have man pages. From these two lists you know what components exist, and you can use *man n name* to get additional information. To view the information in the man page, in a terminal window type:

    man axis (or perhaps 'man 1 axis' if your system requires it.)

### Other<span id="sec:Realtime-Components-other"></span>

 charge\_pump   
Creates a square-wave for the *charge pump* input of some controller boards. The *Charge Pump* should be added to the base thread function. When enabled the output is on for one period and off for one period. To calculate the frequency of the output 1/(period time in seconds x 2) = hz. For example if you have a base period of 100,000ns that is 0.0001 seconds and the formula would be 1/(0.0001 x 2) = 5,000 hz or 5 Khz.

 encoder\_ratio

 estop\_latch   
ESTOP latch.

 feedcomp   
Multiply the input by the ratio of current velocity to the feed rate.

 gearchange

 ilowpass   
<span id="ilowpass"></span> While it may find other applications, this component was written to create smoother motion while jogging with an MPG.

In a machine with high acceleration, a short jog can behave almost like a step function. By putting the ilowpass component between the MPG encoder counts output and the axis jog-counts input, this can be smoothed.

Choose scale conservatively so that during a single session there will never be more than about 2e9/scale pulses seen on the MPG. Choose gain according to the smoothing level desired. Divide the axis.N.jog-scale values by scale.

 joyhandle
